## Additional information to get ready for the hack that starts on October 30th, 2017

Purdue Gold IronHacks Fall 2017 will involve location data, so it is recommended that you go through the Google Maps Tutorial Guide (see above). Below, we provide you with information about open data sets, and also an example submission of a mashup (similar to one that you may submit in the first phase of the hack). For your reference, here is a definition of a **[mashup](https://techterms.com/definition/mashup)**

### 1. Datasets

The IRONHACKS rules require that you use at least TWO open data sets in your project. One dataset is mandatory

Available datasets to choose from:
- **[Climate Data Online](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web)** -- the mandatory dataset <br>

If you want to learn more about the sources of this data:
- **[Data.gov](https://www.data.gov)** -- Official site of the US Government
- **[Open Indy Data Portal](http://data.indy.gov/)** -- Official site of the State of Indiana for open data

You can read more about these datasets [here](Datasets.md)

### 2. Readme File
Please make sure that you also include very descriptive readme file when you commit your application.
- **[Example README](readme_template)**

### 3. Example Submission of a Mashup   

An example submission of a mashup has been completed to get you started (but you do not have to use it). It can be found via the following link. In this example submission, AJAX is used for data retrieval, Google Map Api and D3 are applied for data display.

- **[Dev Process](sample_project)** -- This is a example submission of a mashup. Please keep in mind that is NOT related to your challenge question in the Purdue Gold IronHacks Fall 2017 <br>
